# AutoHotKey-Shortcuts
Multiple Shortcuts for better Productivity: Keep Display On, Lock Display when Mouse is moved, Open VSCode in a Folder, Automatic Launch

# Requirements
make sure you have AutoHotKey 2 installed, which you can get here: <https://www.autohotkey.com/v2>

have VSCode added to Path (check with: `code -v`)

optional: have IntelliJ added to Path

# Hotkey:

- `Alt` + `1` : Opens the AHK Script in VSCode
- `Alt` + `2` : When in Explorer: Open VSCode for the current Folder
- `Alt` + `3` : When in Explorer: Open IntelliJ for the current Folder
- `Alt` + `9` : Checks if the Mouse is moved, if so => locks the User (same as `WIN` + `L`)
- `Alt` + `0` : Presses key's in random time intervals, so the display doesn't go out (The Keys are: `NumLock`, `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `ScrollLock`, )

# Additional Fetures

- Toggle Startup: when clicked on the TrayIcon => toggles the behavior of the script on startup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Popups <b>only</b> work on monitors, not on Laptop Displays (I dont know why) (it makes no sense)
